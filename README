Tobi-duo u-boot patch for the second lan. 

Tested against Sakoman's omap3-v2009.11.1 u-boot branch using
a 2.6.34 kernel.

The basic speed issue for the second nic appears to be okay.
Not a big increase so not urgent.

More testing to do. Something strange happening when both nics are 
being used simultaneously.

The patch is not for an OE build of u-boot, but for a regular
u-boot build.
